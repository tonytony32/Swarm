| Feature | Swarm | IPFS |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Availability | Guaranteed via incentivised storage and retrieval | No guarantees – relies on external pinning services |
| Retrievability   | Native bandwidth market ensures persistent delivery | No native incentives for retrieval |
| Persistence Guarantees | Long-term through economic incentives | Ephemeral unless actively pinned |
| Privacy & Access Control | Built-in encryption and on-chain ACT permissions | No native encryption or access management |
| Censorship Resistance | High – fully decentralised with autonomous guarantees| Limited – centralised services can be pressure points|
| Architecture | Decentralised storage *service* | Decentralised *protocol* |
| Infrastructure Dependencies | Self-sustaining network | Typically needs third-party infrastructure |
| Target Use Case | Production-grade dApps with long-term requirements | File sharing and prototypes, not production storage |
